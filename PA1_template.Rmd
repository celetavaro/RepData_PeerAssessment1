## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## Histogram of the total number of steps each day
```{r sumbyday}
totalEachDay <- tapply(mydata$steps, mydata$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
qplot(totalEachDay, ylab = "Frequency", xlab = "Total steps per day", binwidth = 5000)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r meanacrossdays}
meanAcrossDays <- mean(totalEachDay)
meanAcrossDays
```

## The median total number of steps taken per day:
```{r medianacrossdays}
medianAcrossDays <- median(totalEachDay)
medianAcrossDays
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?





## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
